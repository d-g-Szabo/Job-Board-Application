# Setup instructions:

1.  Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine

2.  Make sure that your local machine has PHP 8.4.1, Composer 2.8.3, and the Laravel installer 5.14.0 installed (Laravel version 12.22.1)

3.  In addition, you should install Node (24.5.0) and NPM (11.5.1) (https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation#creating-a-laravel-project)

    For linux to install PHP, Composer, and the Laravel installer, use this command:

          /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.4)"

4.  Restart your terminal session (close and re-open), to update PHP, Composer, and the Laravel installer, just re-run the above command

5.  Navigate to the app directory in the terminal

        cd to/the/dir/of/the/Job-Board-Application

    Install packages and make a build

        npm install && npm run build
        composer install

    Create a new .env file from the .env.example and set up your DB

    Start the development server

        composer run dev

6.  Open http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:5173/
