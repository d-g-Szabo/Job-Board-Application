- Errors or bugs I encountered while completing your assignment.

# Setup instructions:

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine

2. Make sure that your local machine has PHP 8.4.1, Composer 2.8.3, and the Laravel installer 5.14.0 installed (Laravel version 12.22.1)

3. In addition, you should install Node (24.5.0) and NPM (11.5.1) (https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation#creating-a-laravel-project)

- For linux to install PHP, Composer, and the Laravel installer, use this command:
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.4)"

4.  Restart your terminal session (close and re-open), to update PHP, Composer, and the Laravel installer, just re-run the above command

5.  Navigate to the app directory in the console
    cd to/the/dir/of/the/Job-Board-Application
    Install packages and make a build
