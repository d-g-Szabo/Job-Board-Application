# Reflections:

- Useful external sources that helped me complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).

- Errors or bugs I encountered while completing your assignment.

# Setup instructions:

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine

2. Make sure that your local machine has PHP 8.4.1, Composer 2.8.3, and the Laravel installer 5.14.0 installed (Laravel version 12.22.1)

3. In addition, you should install Node (24.5.0) and NPM (11.5.1) (https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation#creating-a-laravel-project)

For linux use this command:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.4)"

4.  Restart your terminal session, to update just re-run the command

5.      cd to/the/dir/of/the/Job-Board-Application

        npm install && npm run build

        composer run dev // This is how you start the development server

6.  Open http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:5173/
